/*In this portion we will be using all covered knowledge from all topics covered and create a program that will
	grab information from a file, and compare them to each other. I recommend using a linked list to hold the informaton
	because you will be using multiple data types
	
	You are requirement to make a program that will take the Name, Age, and 5 scored through out semester from a file
	and save them to a data structure. This must be done at the beginning of the program to insure that all data has been stored properly

	The program must be able to: 
		1.)Get the average score of the tests and determine the average gpa of the student. 
		2.)Must also be able to able to compare the age of 2 Students and determine which is older.

		It is your job to determine the pattern within the file. "FinalQuestion.txt"

		GOOD LUCK!

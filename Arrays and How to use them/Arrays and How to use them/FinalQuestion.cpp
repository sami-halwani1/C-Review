/*We have no covered some basic ascepts of manipulating arrays

For the Final question, we are going to combine all aspects covered and display the results

Create a program that will take an average of a students test scores through out the semester(5 tests). The program will
first display a sorted from lowest to highest grades. The program will then drop the lowest test score and take the average.
The program will decide whether the student passed or failed that class.

example:

		Students Name: Sami
		Test Scores: 100 54 80 74 88
		
		Sorted Scores: 54 74 80 88 100
		Average after lowest score has been dropped: 85.5
		Sami passed the class!
		
		*end program*
		


		*Hint: When you drop a score, the number of tests will now be n-1*
